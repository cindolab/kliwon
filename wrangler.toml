# Serve static assets from the current directory, excluding src and other hidden files.
# But wait, `assets` binding is usually for Pages or Workers Sites.
# For a pure Worker project, we typically use `[assets]` if supported or just `[site]` for legacy.
# A simpler approach for this static site is to use `[site]` configuration pointing to current directory `.`
# BUT `[site]` is deprecated in favor of Cloudflare Pages.
# However, the user specifically mentioned "workers/services/view/kliwon" which implies a Worker.
# Let's try to use the newer `assets` capability if available, or just stick to `[site]`.
# Given the user's existing setup, they likely want a Worker that can serve static content.

# Let's try a standard worker configuration.
# If they are using `wrangler dev`, it might need `[site]`.
# Let's add `[site]` configuration pointing to `.` so the worker can access files.
# AND we need to make sure the worker code actually serves them.
# The previous `worker.js` I wrote was a placeholder.
# I should update `worker.js` to actually serve static assets using `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` logic or similar IF this is a Workers Site.
# BUT that adds dependency complexity (npm install).
# The undeniable simplest way for a user without node_modules is to use `wrangler pages deploy .`
# BUT they asked to update the *repo*.
# So I will provide a `wrangler.toml` that is standard.

# Let's assume they might use `wrangler deploy`.
# If I use `[assets]`, it's the modern way:
# [assets]
# directory = "."
# binding = "ASSETS"

# Let's go with this modern config.

[assets]
directory = "./dist"
binding = "ASSETS"
